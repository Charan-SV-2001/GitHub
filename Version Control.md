# Version control
- It is a system that tracks changes to files, enabling collaborative development and ensuring project integrity.


## Distributed version control systems (DVCS) :
- It enable users to work with complete repository copies, promoting decentralized collaboration, flexible branching, merging, and offline access.
- exemple:  Git, Mercurial

## Centralized version control systems (CVCS):
- It rely on a central repository for version management, where users check out files for modification and commit changes back to the central server.
- exemple:  Subversion (SVN).
