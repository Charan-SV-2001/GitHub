## SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. 

It is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, and test high-quality software. 


SDLC process consists of seven phases:
### 1. Requirement Gatherings: 
	- In this initial phase, the development team interacts to understand the needs and gather requirements,
	- tools: Microsoft Project, JIRA , trello
		-  JIRA:  For tracking requirements, issues, and tasks.
		-  Trello:  For organizing and prioritizing requirements in a Kanban board format.
		-  Microsoft Project:  A project management software that helps in creating project plans, assigning resources, and tracking progress.
		-  Asana 
### 2. System Analysis: 
	-This phase involves analysing the gathered requirement with the systemâ€™s overall architecture, components, and data flow.
	-Understand and document the requirements and goals of the project.
	   	-  Confluence:  For documenting requirements and collaborating on them.
		-  Track and Rally 
		-  Click Up 
### 3. Design: 
	- The team designs the software based on analysis and needs.
	- Create a plan for how the software will be built, including its architecture and user interface.
	   	-  Lucidchart:  For creating system architecture diagrams and visualizing system flows.
		-  Draw.io:  Similar to Lucidchart, it's a diagramming tool for system analysis and design.
		-  Adobe XD:  For designing user interfaces and prototypes.
		-  Sketch:  Another UI/UX design tool commonly used for designing interfaces.
		-  Sigma: 
### 4. Implementation: 
	- Also known as the coding phase, in which the software development takes place.
	- Write the actual code and develop the software according to the design specifications.
	   	-  Git:  For version control and managing code repositories.
		-  GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:  Platforms for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code.
		-  Jenkins:  For continuous integration and automating the build process.
### 5. Testing: 
	* Software is tested to identify faults and bugs and to ensure the proper functioning of the software.
	* Verify that the software works correctly and meets the requirements through various testing processes.
		- Selenium: For automated web application testing.
		- JUnit: For unit testing Java applications.
		- Postman: For testing APIs and services.
		- Sonar cube:
		- JMeter: For performance testing and load testing.
### 6. Deployment: 
	- Once tested, the software is deployed to the end-user
	- Release the software to users and make it available for use, along with any necessary training and support.
		--> Docker: For containerization and packaging applications into containers.
		--> Kubernetes: For container orchestration and managing containerized applications.
		--> Ansible: For automating deployment tasks and configuration management.
		--> Terraform: For infrastructure as code, automating the provisioning of infrastructure.
### 7. Maintenance: 
	After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. It includes monitoring software, fixing bugs and making updates if required.
	--> Nagios: For monitoring system performance and alerting on issues.
	--> Prometheus: For monitoring and alerting on metrics.
	--> Dynatrace: For ongoing monitoring and analysis of system performance and health.





## Distributed version control systems (DVCS) :
	It enable users to work with complete repository copies, promoting decentralized collaboration, flexible branching, merging, and offline access, exemplified by Git, Mercurial

## Centralized version control systems (CVCS):
 It rely on a central repository for version management, where users check out files for modification and commit changes back to the central server, exemplified by systems like CVS and Subversion (SVN).

### Repository:

**What is repository?**
	- A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
	- Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. README files are written in the plain text Markdown language


**create repository**

	- Template: A repository template is a predefined structure or layout that serves as a starting point for new repositories, streamlining the creation process by providing common files, folders, and configurations.When using a repository template, the following elements are commonly included:	
		1. Default file and directory structure: Provides a basic organization for project files.
		2. Configuration files: Includes settings for tools, such as CI/CD pipelines or linters.
		3. README and CONTRIBUTING files: Offers guidance on how to use and contribute to the project.
		4. License file: Specifies the terms under which the project is distributed.
		5. Code snippets or examples: Offers reusable code snippets or example files.
		6. Documentation: Provides initial documentation to help users understand the project.

	- Repo visibility: Repository visibility determines who can access and view a repository.
		1. Public  : Accessible to everyone, suitable for open-source projects.
		2. Internal: Visible within the organization, maintaining privacy from external users.
		3: Private : Restricts access to users with explicit permission, ideal for proprietary projects.
  		Note: org admin and enterprise admin can see the repo 


	- Readme file: A README file is a straightforward document that explains key details about a project.

	- gitignore: A .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, such as build artifacts or temporary files, to keep the repository clean.


## Repository
	1. Code       	    : Stores project files and source code.
	2. Issues  	    : Tracks bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
	3. Pull Requests    : Manages proposed changes and code reviews.
	4. **Actions**      : Automates workflows and tasks.
	5. **Projects**     : Organizes tasks, issues, and pull requests.
	6. **Wiki**         : Provides collaborative documentation.
	7. **Security**     : Manages security alerts and settings.
	8. **Insights**     : Offers analytics and repository statistics.
	9. **Settings**     : Configures repository options and permissions.
	10. **Discussion**   : Platform for conversations, questions, and feedback related to the repository.
