# SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. 
- It is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, and test high-quality software. 
- SDLC process consists of seven phases:
### 1. Requirement Gatherings: 
	- In this initial phase, the development team interacts to understand the needs and gather requirements,
	- tools: Microsoft Project, JIRA , trello
		-  JIRA:  For tracking requirements, issues, and tasks.
		-  Trello:  For organizing and prioritizing requirements in a Kanban board format.
		-  Microsoft Project:  A project management software that helps in creating project plans, assigning resources, and tracking progress.
		-  Asana 
### 2. System Analysis: 
	-This phase involves analysing the gathered requirement with the systemâ€™s overall architecture, components, and data flow.
	-Understand and document the requirements and goals of the project.
	   	-  Confluence:  For documenting requirements and collaborating on them.
		-  Track and Rally 
		-  Click Up 
### 3. Design: 
	- The team designs the software based on analysis and needs.
	- Create a plan for how the software will be built, including its architecture and user interface.
	   	-  Lucidchart:  For creating system architecture diagrams and visualizing system flows.
		-  Draw.io:  Similar to Lucidchart, it's a diagramming tool for system analysis and design.
		-  Adobe XD:  For designing user interfaces and prototypes.
		-  Sketch:  Another UI/UX design tool commonly used for designing interfaces.
		-  Sigma: 
### 4. Implementation: 
	- Also known as the coding phase, in which the software development takes place.
	- Write the actual code and develop the software according to the design specifications.
	   	-  Git:  For version control and managing code repositories.
		-  GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:  Platforms for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code.
		-  Jenkins:  For continuous integration and automating the build process.
### 5. Testing: 
	* Software is tested to identify faults and bugs and to ensure the proper functioning of the software.
	* Verify that the software works correctly and meets the requirements through various testing processes.
		- Selenium: For automated web application testing.
		- JUnit: For unit testing Java applications.
		- Postman: For testing APIs and services.
		- Sonar cube:
		- JMeter: For performance testing and load testing.
### 6. Deployment: 
	- Once tested, the software is deployed to the end-user
	- Release the software to users and make it available for use, along with any necessary training and support.
		--> Docker: For containerization and packaging applications into containers.
		--> Kubernetes: For container orchestration and managing containerized applications.
		--> Ansible: For automating deployment tasks and configuration management.
		--> Terraform: For infrastructure as code, automating the provisioning of infrastructure.
### 7. Maintenance: 
	After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. It includes monitoring software, fixing bugs and making updates if required.
	--> Nagios: For monitoring system performance and alerting on issues.
	--> Prometheus: For monitoring and alerting on metrics.
	--> Dynatrace: For ongoing monitoring and analysis of system performance and health.
